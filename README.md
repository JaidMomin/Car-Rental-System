# Car-Rental-System

## Description
The Car Rental System is a console-based Java application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts. It simulates a basic car rental service, allowing users to rent and return cars, manage customer and vehicle data, and view rental history. This project is ideal for understanding how OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Features
Rent a Car:
1. Users can browse available cars and rent them through a simple and interactive console interface.
2. Car availability is updated after each successful rental.

Return a Car:
1. Allows users to return the rented car.
2. The system updates the car status to available and records the return time.

Customer Management:
1. Add new customers with essential details like name, contact number, and ID.
2. View and manage existing customer records.

Car Management:
1. Add new cars to the system with attributes like brand, model, and rental price.
2. Modify car details or delete entries.

Rental History:
1. Maintains a record of all car rentals.
2. Displays details such as car rented, customer name, rental and return date/time.

## üíª Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
IDE: Visual Studio Code or any Java-supported IDE
Data Storage: In-memory (ArrayList or HashMap)

## Installation & Setup Instructions:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your preferred Java IDE.
2. Create a new Java project or folder.
3. Add all the .java files related to the project.
4. Compile and run the Main.java file.
5. Use the console interface to explore features like renting, returning cars, and viewing history.
Note: No database setup required. All data is handled using Java collections.
